Backend process loads data from lidl app to google cloud storage. The invoice .pdf's are processed via a processor (form parser) and creat a table of all invoices. This data is enriched by the open food facts library and further data created by a table created by PALM2. This data is the output for the visualisations in the front-end and the input for the food advisor. The food advisor is also based on PALM2 and creates a table for similar food suggestions (in terms of nutrition) but more healthy and less co2 consuming.
